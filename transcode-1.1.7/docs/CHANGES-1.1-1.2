User-visible changes betwwen transcode 1.1.0 and transcode 1.2.0
================================================================
(Revision 1)

Introduction
------------

This document outlines the user-visible changes between transcode
1.1.x and transcode 1.2.0. If you find a difference that isn't
documented here, please file a bug on tcforge.berlios.de and/or
write us on transcode-devel@exit1.org.

Configuration
-------------

Formerly-mandatory packages:
- libavcodec
- libavformat
- libmpeg2/libmpeg2convert
are now optional.

Command line options:
---------------------

* -t/--split [changed]
  the long name is now `--split_time'
  accepts now only an argument, being the size of each output chunk,
  in megabytes. The basename is now implied by -o.

* --avi_limit [changed]
  renamed in `--split_size'. This option now applies to each supported
  output format.

* --export_prof [changed]
  accepts now any string (being a profile name) as argument.

* -y/--export_with [changed]
  accepts now keyword arguments. A keyword argument has the key=value
  form, meaning that the ordering of field is no longer significant.
  (this also mean that you're no longer forced to re-specify the leftmost
  fields if you changed a rightmost).
  Recognizes a third and fourth field for the muxer and auxiliary muxer
  (useful if you specify -m) too.
  This option is NO LONGER mandatory. (see -N below).
  Examples (1.1.0 -> 1.2.0)

  change the video export module:
  -y foo -> -y V=foo

  change the video and the audio export module:
  -y foo,bar -> y V=foo,A=bar (equivalent: -y A=bar,V=foo)

  change the audio export module:
  -y same_as_before,foo -> -y A=foo

* -N/--export_codec [changed]
  accepts now keyword arguments. A keyword argument has the key=value
  form, meaning that the ordering of field is no longer significant.
  (this also mean that you're no longer forced to re-specify the leftmost
  fields if you changed a rightmost).
  transcode can now autodetect the appropriate export modules given the
  export format (for encoders) and the output filename (for the muxer).
  This mean that option -y is no longer mandatory (see above).
